## Quick Reaction Game

In this resource, you're going to make a quick reaction game using a few electronic components and a Python script. If you've never before used a breadboard, some buttons, and an LED, you might find it helpful to work through some of the exercises in [Physical Computing with Python](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing) first. This will give you a better understanding of how to control components with the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
